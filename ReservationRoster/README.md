Assignment from CSC 4992 - Android Development class at Wayne State University.

This application is a demonstration of the use of TimerTask and sharing data between Threads using a Singleton object.

Basically, it has a listview of reservations with a waiting time, and there is a timertask that reduce the waiting time of every reservation by a random number until 0.
We can start/stop the timertask and also add manually reservations.
